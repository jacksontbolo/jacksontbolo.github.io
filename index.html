    <section id="About">
        <h1 style="text-align: center">I never thought I'd end up here, but I'm glad I did!</h1>
        <br>

    <p class="text-center">My journey in web development began as an exciting opportunity, one I've been glad to have taken the winter break of my sophomore year. I was directed to a nifty and intriguing program through 1150 Academy; I was admittingly nervous that I wouldn't crack the code early on... sorry, I'll give you a minute to recover from that pun.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-center">I had always been tempted to start with coding, but I found the disorganizied search I had many times to go on for information was frustrating, as I couldn't keep concepts together before having to quickly process the next part of a lesson.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-center">That changed with 1150 Academy! Learning with live active instructors kept everything I wanted to learn for HTML, CSS, and Javascript coherently together! I was also able to work out issues as they came up and learn through every single detail of my time in the class. That's what 1150 sold me on, and with the assistance of everyone on board, I've gained a new love and passion writing down projects in code. They gave me the chance to create for myself in a sought after and fulfilling way; I'd recommend the program to everyone!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-center">With my background in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, I'm both naturally enthralled to learning the science behind what we see in everyday life and curious as to how I can capture said concepts for my own aspirations and projects. Coding has thus opened a new avenue for me to represent myself and the work that can be done through the power of the internet.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="text-center">Coding also allows me to create; I've had a long background the arts and understanding how what we create strikes a cord with those around us. Knowing how to develop not represents what I create; it allows me to always have an incredible and limitless base for creativity, and I couldn't be happier to have the avenue open to me.</p>
